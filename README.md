Test project for CodeBridge
===========================

### The task

There is an MS SQL database with just one table: select top(2) * from dogs limit 2;
name	color	tail_length	weight
Neo	red & amber	22	32
Jessy	black & white	7	14
(2 rows)

You need to develop the following API on top of it:

1. Your application should have an action called "Ping". It should work in the following way:

curl -X GET http://localhost/ping should return the following message: "Dogs house service. Version 1.0.1"

2. Your application should have an action that allows querying dogs. It should work in the following way:

curl -X GET http://localhost/dogs should return the following:

[
{"name": "Neo", "color": "red & amber", "tail_length": 22, "weight": 32},
{"name": "Jessy", "color": "black & white", "tail_length": 7, "weight": 14}
]

API should support sorting by attribute, for example, curl -X GET http://localhost/dogs?attribute=weight&order=desc

API should support pagination, for example, curl -X GET http://localhost/dogs?pageNumber=3&limit=pageSize=10

Both sorting and pagination should work together.

3. Your application should have an action that allows creating dogs. It should work in the following way:

curl -X POST http://localhost/dog

-d "{"name": "Doggy", "color": "red", "tail_length": 173, "weight": 33}"

As a result, a new dog should be created.

Please think about the following cases:

    Dog with the same name already exists in DB.
    Tail height is a negative number or is not a number.
    Invalid JSON is passed in a request body.
    Other cases that need to be handled in order for API to work properly.

4. Please implement logic that handles situations when there are too many incoming requests to the application, so those could not be handled. There should be a setting that says how many requests the service can handle, for example, 10 requests per second. In case there are more incoming requests than in configuration application should return HTTP status code "429 Too Many Requests".

Here are a few additional requirements for the task:

    Use ASP .Net Core Web API.
    Use EF Core code first for the database creation (any database).
    Use async-await where it's possible.
    All logic in the application should be covered by unit tests.
    Please show your knowledge of different software development patterns.
